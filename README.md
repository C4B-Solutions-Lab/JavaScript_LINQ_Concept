# JavaScript LINQ Concept 1.0

![JavaScript LINQ Concept](/JLC_1_0_logo.png)

This library is aimed to work in FCU or in the FrontEnd apps in general and will serve the same purpose as LINQ in C# ! \
The parameters of methods of the same names like C#'s LINQ are exactly the same or as close as possible. \
\
My goal is to "copy" functionality from LINQ in C# and transfer it stright into plain JavaScript. \
\
I am not sure whether *the great* **Anders Hejlsberg** of *Microsoft* will welcome it or not, but for sure I am not breaking any rules of good software development.


I highly encourage reading this amazing article treating about [C# LINQ in detail](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/383749/How-does-it-work-in-Csharp-Part-3-Csharp-LINQ-in-d "How does it work in C# ?") to better understand inner workings of LINQ ! \
By the way, taking advantage of the occasion there are 3 books that every C#-oriented developer should have on his/her shelf... \
(guess, whether I have them or not ? :smirk:)
