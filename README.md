# JavaScript LINQ Concept 1.0
This library is aimed to work in FCU or in the FrontEnd apps in general and will serve the same purpose as LINQ in C# ! \
The parameters of methods of the same names in C#'s LINQ are exactly the same or as close as possible. \
\
My goal is to "copy" functionality from LINQ in C# and transfer it stright into plain JavaScript. \
\
I am not sure whether the great Anders Hejlsberg of Microsoft will welcome it or not, but for sure I am not breaking any rules of good software development.
